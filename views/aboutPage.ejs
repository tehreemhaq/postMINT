        About Me
      </h2>

      <p class="text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
        I’m a naturally curious person who enjoys understanding how things work,
        especially in technology. I’m more drawn to the backend side of development,
        where logic, structure, and clarity matter more than surface-level polish.
        I’m not an expert, but I’m confident in my ability to learn new concepts,
        question existing ones, and improve through practice.
      </p>

      <p class="text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Outside of code, my curiosity extends to other areas as well. I enjoy reading
        and exploring ideas related to psychology, politics, economics, and how
        different cultures and value systems shape the way people think. I don’t
        have a long list of hobbies, but I’m slowly building one, and gardening is
        next on that list.

    <!-- Experience -->

        Experience
      </h2>

      <p class="text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
        I’m currently a student, and alongside my studies I’ve gained experience
        teaching and mentoring younger students. Explaining concepts clearly,
        adapting to different learning styles, and breaking down complex ideas
        into simple steps has helped me develop patience and communication skills
        that carry over into everything else I do.

        This website, PostMint, is my first complete working project. It’s not
        perfect, and it wasn’t meant to be. The goal was to build something real,
        understand the full flow from backend logic to user experience, and
        improve it incrementally while learning new concepts along the way.

    About This Website
  </h2>

<p class="text-zinc-600 mb-4">
  PostMint is a small, minimal space I built to share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings without unnecessary noise.
  The goal is not to chase trends or polish perfection, but to create something simple, intentional, and
  continuously improving.
   <br>
   The name reflects the idea of keeping things fresh and thoughtful.
</p>


<p class="text-zinc-600 mb-4">
  This project is also my first complete, working application. It is far from perfect, but it represents
  real effort, real learning, and a foundation I plan to keep refining as I grow technically and personally.
</p>


  <p class="text-zinc-500 italic">
    This site is a work in progress, just like me.
